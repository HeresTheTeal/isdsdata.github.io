            <p id="main">ISDS is a neutral, international arbitration procedure. Like other forms of commercial, labor, or judicial arbitration, ISDS seeks to provide an impartial, law-based approach to resolve conflicts. Various forms of ISDS are now a part of over 3,000 agreements worldwide, of which the United States is party to 50.</p>

            <p id="main">University of Georgia professor Tim Samples has done extensive research on ISDS cases, award amounts, and other relevant data. Professor Samples led an ISDS Research Team, which created an extensive dataset from information available on <a href="http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ISDS" target="_blank">UNCTAD</a>.</p>
